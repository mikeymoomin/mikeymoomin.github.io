# Beginning My CS Learning Journey

As a Chartered Accountant, I've spent years working with financial systems and data, but I've always been curious about the technology that powers these systems. That curiosity finally led me to take the plunge into computer science learning.

## Why I Decided to Learn CS

There are several reasons I've decided to embark on this journey:

1. **Professional Development**: Understanding the technical underpinnings of the financial software I use daily will make me more effective at my job.

2. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Computer science teaches structured problem-solving approaches that can be applied in many areas.

3. **Future-Proofing**: As technology continues to transform the accounting profession, having technical skills will be increasingly valuable.

## My Learning Plan

I'm starting with these fundamental areas:

- **Programming Basics**: Learning Python as my first language
- **Web Development**: Understanding how websites and web applications work
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: The building blocks of computer science
- **Databases**: How data is stored, retrieved, and managed

## First Steps

I've already completed my first Python course and built a simple calculator application. It's amazing how satisfying it is to write code that actually works!

```python
def calculate_tax(income, rate):

# Example usage
annual_income = 50000
tax_rate = 20
tax_amount = calculate_tax(annual_income, tax_rate)
print(f"Tax amount: Â£{tax_amount}")
```

## Next Steps

Next week, I'll be diving into HTML and CSS to start understanding web development. I'm planning to document my progress with each new technology I
